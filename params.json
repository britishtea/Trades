{"name":"Trades","body":"Installation\r\n============\r\n\r\nOpen up your terminal and type `gem install trades` or `sudo gem install trades` if the former gives you errors.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can download the 'trades-x.x.gem' file (listed above) and install that using `gem install /path/to/trades-x.x.gem` (replace x.x).\r\n\r\nYou need to have [Ruby](http://ruby.about.com/od/tutorials/a/installruby.htm) and [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download) (included by default) installed. To test if you've got Ruby installed, type `ruby -v` in your terminal. This should display a version number if Ruby is installed.\r\n\r\nTrades is developed and tested on Ruby version **1.9.2**.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\n\tUsage: trades [options]\r\n\r\n\tOptions:\r\n\t    -m, --market MARKET              Filter on MARKET\r\n\t    -c, --currency CURRENCY          Filter on CURRENCY\r\n\t    -l, --log [FILENAME]             Log the results to FILENAME\r\n\t        --no-color                   Plain text instead of output colorized\r\n\t        --markets                    Show a list of all markets\r\n\t        --currencies                 Show a list of all currencies\r\n\t    -h, --help                       Show this message\r\n\r\n\r\nMore info: https://github.com/britishtea/Trades\r\n\r\nTo filter on market, type `trades -m mtgoxUSD` in your terminal. Type `trades -m mtgoxUSD -m thUSD` to filter on multiple markets. Trades uses the same names for markets as Bitcoincharts uses, though Trades has some aliases built-in. \r\n\r\nTo filter on currency, type `trades -c USD` in your terminal. Type `trades -c USD -c EUR -c GBP` to filter on multiple currencies.\r\n\r\nTo log the results to a file, type `trades -l /location/trades.log` in your terminal. If no file is given, Trades will create a logfile in /var/log/. You can use this option in combination with one of the filtering options.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAll data is provided by [Bitcoincharts.com](http://bitcoincharts.com/). As long as you don't sell Trades for monies (or bitcoins!) you can do anything you want with it, except for rape.\r\n\r\nDonations: 1PfTKrqoZpi9iUQVEqmCQTKkbXEGPNrypj","tagline":"Displays the real-time data on Bitcoincharts.com nicely","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
